# 🔄 AI Recipe Repository Update

## 📝 Summary
Updated the `ai_meal_repository.dart` file with improved AI recipe generation implementation based on your original source code.

## ✨ Key Improvements Made

### 1. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- Added API key validation with user-friendly error messages
- Improved error handling with detailed logging
- Better fallback mechanisms for failed API calls

### 2. **Improved API Integration**
- Enhanced MIME type detection for images (`picture.mimeType ?? 'image/jpeg'`)
- Better handling of both single and multiple image inputs
- More robust API key management with debugging output

### 3. **Superior Prompt Engineering**
- **Multiple Images**: Optimized for analyzing multiple ingredient images together
- **Single Image**: Streamlined prompt for single image analysis  
- **Text Input**: Enhanced prompts for ingredient list processing
- **Markdown Formatting**: Requests properly formatted markdown responses

### 4. **Enhanced Vietnamese Language Support**
- Expanded Vietnamese word detection list (40+ common food terms)
- Better Unicode character detection for Vietnamese text
- Improved Vietnamese language instructions with cultural context
- Proper Vietnamese measurement units (gram, kg, thìa, chén, etc.)

### 5. **Better Language Detection**
- More comprehensive Vietnamese character pattern matching
- Enhanced word-based language detection
- Automatic language switching based on user input

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### API Key Management
```dart
// New: Better error handling
if (apiKey == null || apiKey!.isEmpty) {
  return ['Error: API key not configured. Please check your .env file.'];
}

// New: Debug logging
print('Using API key: ${apiKey!.substring(0, 10)}...');
```

### Enhanced Prompts
```dart
// New: More specific prompt structure
String prompt = '''You are a very experienced diet Planner. I want to have a 3 options for a meal using only the ingredients in the picture. 
I need the receipt step by step to easily understand it and format me using only markdown. 
I want the quantity of the ingredients for ${parameters.people.toString()} people and I only want to spend a maximum of ${parameters.maxTimeCooking.toString()} minutes to make the meal.

$languageInstruction
''';
```

### Improved Vietnamese Detection
```dart
// New: Extended Vietnamese word list
List<String> vietnameseWords = [
  'thit', 'heo', 'bo', 'ga', 'ca', 'tom', 'cua', 'oc',
  'rau', 'cai', 'hanh', 'toi', 'gung', 'ot', 'nuoc',
  'mam', 'tuong', 'dau', 'gao', 'bun', 'mien', 'banh',
  'pho', 'xoi', 'nem', 'cha', // ... and more
];
```

## 🎯 Expected Results

### Better Recipe Quality
- More accurate ingredient analysis from images
- Better formatted recipes using markdown
- More appropriate portion sizes and cooking times
- Culturally relevant Vietnamese dishes when Vietnamese is detected

### Improved User Experience  
- Clearer error messages when API issues occur
- Better language detection and automatic switching
- More reliable image processing with proper MIME types
- Debug logging for troubleshooting

### Enhanced Reliability
- Robust error handling prevents app crashes
- Better API key validation
- Improved response parsing and validation

## 🔍 Compatibility
- ✅ Maintains existing `AiMealSettingsParameters` interface
- ✅ Compatible with current meal_cubit implementation
- ✅ Preserves all existing functionality
- ✅ Backward compatible with single image mode

## 🚀 Ready for Testing
The updated repository is now ready for testing with:
- Single image recipe generation
- Multiple image recipe generation  
- Text-based ingredient recipe generation
- Vietnamese language detection and responses
- Error handling and API key validation

This implementation combines the best of both approaches - maintaining the existing architecture while incorporating your improved prompt engineering and error handling! 🎉
