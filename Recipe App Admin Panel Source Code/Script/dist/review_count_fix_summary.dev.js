/**
 * ‚úÖ REVIEW COUNT FIX SUMMARY
 * 
 * Problem: Review count was showing incorrect numbers
 * 
 * Root Cause: 
 * - Widget was prioritizing _model.calculatedTotalReviews (from separate API call)
 * - Instead of widget.totalReviews (from GetRecipeById API which has correct count)
 * 
 * Solution:
 * 1. Changed priority logic: widget.totalReviews > _model.calculatedTotalReviews > _model.reviews.length
 * 2. Applied same logic to both header text and button text
 * 3. Fixed singular/plural text: "1 Review" vs "X Reviews"
 * 
 * Expected Results:
 * ‚úÖ Honey Chilli Potato: Shows "1 Review" and "View 1 Review" button
 * ‚úÖ Oats Porridge: Shows "3 Reviews" and "View All 3 Reviews" button
 * ‚úÖ Both use accurate data from GetRecipeById API (totalReviews field)
