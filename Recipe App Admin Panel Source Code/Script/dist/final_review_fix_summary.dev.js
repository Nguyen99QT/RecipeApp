/**
 * ✅ FINAL FIX: Recipe Detail Screen Rating Display
 * 
 * Problem Found:
 * - Top section was showing: "Rating (totalRating)" 
 * - totalRating = SUM of all rating scores (wrong for display)
 * - Should show: "Rating (totalReviews)"
 * - totalReviews = COUNT of reviews (correct for display)
 * 
 * Examples:
 * 🔧 BEFORE (Wrong):
 *    - Honey Chilli Potato: "5.0 (5)" - confusing! 
 *    - Oats Porridge: "4.7 (14)" - what does 14 mean?
 * 
 * ✅ AFTER (Fixed):
 *    - Honey Chilli Potato: "5.0 (1)" - clear! 5 stars from 1 review
 *    - Oats Porridge: "4.7 (3)" - clear! 4.7 stars from 3 reviews
 * 
 * Technical Change:
 * - Changed: RecipeAppGroup.getRecipeByIdApiCall.totalRating()
 * - To: RecipeAppGroup.getRecipeByIdApiCall.totalReviews()
 * - In: recipe_detail_screen_widget.dart line ~765
