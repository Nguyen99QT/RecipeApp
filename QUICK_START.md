### Download & Install These First:
1. **Node.js** - Download from: https://nodejs.org/ (choose LTS version)
2. **MongoDB** - Download from: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community
3. **Android Studio** - Download from: https://developer.android.com/studio
4. **Flutter SDK** - Download from: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install

## Step-by-Step Setup

### üöÄ Quick Start (5 Minutes)

#### Step 1: Start Database
- **Windows**: MongoDB starts automatically after installation
- **Mac/Linux**: Open terminal and run: `sudo systemctl start mongod`

#### Step 2: Start Admin Panel
1. Open Command Prompt/Terminal
2. Navigate to project folder:
   ```
   cd "Recipe App Admin Panel Source Code/Script"
   ```
3. Install dependencies (first time only):
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the admin panel:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
5. Open browser and go to: **http://localhost:3000**

#### Step 3: Start Mobile App
1. Open new Command Prompt/Terminal
2. Navigate to Flutter app:
   ```
   cd "Flutter Receipe App/recipe_app"
   ```
3. Install dependencies (first time only):
   ```
   flutter pub get
   ```
4. Start Android emulator from Android Studio
5. Run the app:
   ```
   flutter run
   ```

### ‚úÖ Verification
- Admin panel should open in browser at http://localhost:3000
- Mobile app should appear on Android emulator
- Both should connect and work together

**start_admin.bat**
```batch
@echo off
cd "Recipe App Admin Panel Source Code\Script"
npm start
pause
```

**start_app.bat**
```batch
@echo off
